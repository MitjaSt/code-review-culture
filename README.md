# Dev culture

Culture is often overlooked by a team, not knowing that culture is what drives a team to build, produce, and maintain great products.

## Code Reviews

> The discipline of discussing your code to your peers. - *Derek Prior*

People seem to think that code reviews are meant to find bugs. While that is true to some extent it doesn't really meet the level of expencation set by developers and managers. It is better to look at code reviews as a way to transfer knowledge from one developer to another this is how developers get better at their jobs everyday.

### What are code reviews good for?

- Knowledge transfer
- Increased team awareness
- Finding alternative solutions

#### Knowledge transfer

> If Content is King, then Context is God. - *Gary Vaynerchuk*

This is probably one of the most important parts of a code review process. Having knowledge of the purpose of any code snippet is what makes a good team an awesome team. This also helps developers have a mindset of writing their code in a much more readable and easily shared piece of work.

#### Increased team awareness

#### Finding alternative solutions

I cannot stress this enough, having another set of eyes to look at any given code is better than just one since no two developers are alike and each developer has probably developed their own way of thinking ho to solve problems.
