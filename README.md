# Dev culture

Culture is often overlooked by a team, not knowing that culture is what drives a team to build, produce, and maintain great products.

## Code Reviews

People seem to think that code reviews are meant to find bugs. While that is true to some extent it doesn't really meet the level of expencation set by developers and managers. It is better to look at code reviews as a way to transfer knowledge from one developer to another this is how developers get better at their jobs everyday.

### What are code reviews good for?

- Knowledge transfer
- Increased team awareness
- Finding alternative solutions
- The discipline of explaining your code to your peers

#### Finding alternative solutions

I cannot strees this enough, having another set of eyes to look at any given code is better than just one since no two developers are alike and each developer has probably developed their own way of thinking ho to solve problems.
